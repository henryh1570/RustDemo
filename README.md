capabilities of the Rust programming languages which is speed and safety.

Abstraction
-----------
This is a basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life. This is a 0-player
game where some unmoving Cells will interact with each other by sending
projectiles across a 2-Dimensional plane, a Grid. The game may be seeded
with certain initial cells and positions for these cells that may yield 
predictable behavior. Regardless of seeding, the initial cells will solely 
determine the interaction and patterns displayed by rendering the world.
